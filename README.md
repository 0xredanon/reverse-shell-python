# Reverse Shell

## Description
This is a simple reverse shell implementation in Python. It demonstrates how a client can connect to a server and execute commands remotely. This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activity.

The server listens for incoming connections from the client and executes commands sent by the server. The client connects to the server and executes commands remotely, sending back the results.

## Features
- Bidirectional communication between client and server.
- Supports execution of shell commands.
- Simple to set up and run.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
